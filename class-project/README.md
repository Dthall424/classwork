My Code Louisville Back-end project :
  This is a re-written version of my front end project that has the same essential functionality, but with more options in terms of
  using an API for information from the internet. My goal for this project is for the site to turn into a collections of all my work
  for others to see.

  I used "create-React-App" to build the ground floor of this project***

  In order to run my project, open your terminal and follow these steps:

  1) git clone https://github.com/Dthall424/classwork.git
  2) cd classwork && cd class-project
  3) atom . or code .  --- (just open this file with your editor)
  4) npm install
  5) npm start
